## Problem Statement ü§î

A safe space for non-tech people to explore AI without feeling like they need to be tech experts. Additionally, create opportunities for non-tech people to interact with AI to ask questions and gain insights into how AI can be used in their field. And showcase to them, what true state-of-the-art AI is capable of.

# Our Solution üöÄ 

Our approach to this problem statement is to create  a Smart Assistant  that lets users interact with advanced stable diffusion models like gpt, dalle-mini  and many more... using text or speech to get responses in the same format. New State of the art in deep learning is capable of marvellous things but sadly non-tech people haven't had the opportunity to interact with them and see what a true AI assistant is capable of, we aim to grant them this experience and much more. We aim to create a comprehensive backend with a NLP model which decide which model will be appropriate for which query and then use a version of the model customized by us to provide the user with the desired output, we want to adopt the Apple methodology and make it work like a totally synchronized machine, so that it feels like magic to the user.

Our goal is to differentiate ourselves from generic smart assistants like Alexa, Google assistant and Siri and provide more of a, human interaction experience to the user. We are committed to making this chatbot as user-friendly as possible, and we believe that it has the potential to be better than any other chatbot on the market.

Moreover, we want the use to feel like they are interacting with an extremely smart and handy human rather than a machine.
Our app, developed to its full potential, will be a revolutionary product that will change the way people interact with artificial intelligence, totally awestrucking the target audience a one of a kind experience at their finger tips welcoming them into an age of general purpose AI.

PS: "If you liked our approach you are already an attestment to the power of Deep Learning, as gpt3 wrote it ;), welcome to the age of general purpose AI" üòé
